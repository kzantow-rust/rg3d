# FyroxEd

Full-featured editor for [Fyrox engine](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox). This is the basic library for the editor, 
it cannot be run as executable. See `editor-standalone` for this.

The main purpose of making the editor library is to use it with static plugins, see `scripting` example for more info.
