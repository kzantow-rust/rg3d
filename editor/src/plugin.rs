/// Editor plugin allows you to extend editor functionality with custom tools. It provides a standard way of interaction
/// between your plugin and built-in editor's functionality.
///
/// ## Development Patterns
///
/// There are multiple development patterns that **should** (and strongly advised) be used. Following them will help you to
/// write your tools _the right way_.
///
/// ### MVC
///
/// The editor uses classic [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (model-view-controller)
/// pattern. This means that the editor always "renders" the actual state of your data model and its UI is used only to show
/// the data - it does not store anything. Any user change forces the editor to sync the UI with the new data.
///
/// ### Commands
///
/// The editor usually operates on scenes (there could be multiple opened scenes, but only one active) and any modification of
/// their content **must** be done via _commands_. [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) is a standard
/// pattern that encapsulates an action. Command pattern is used for undo/redo functionality.
pub trait EditorPlugin: Downcast {
    /// This method is called right after the editor was fully initialized. It is guaranteed to be called only once.
    fn on_start(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is called when the editor is about to close. It is guaranteed to be called only once.
    fn on_exit(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is called either when there was some action via command, or a syncing request is performed. It should
    /// be used to synchronize the state of your widgets with the actual data model.  
    fn on_sync_to_model(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is called when the editor switches to another mode. For example, if a user clicks the "Play" button,
    /// the mode will be changed from [`crate::Mode::Edit`] to [`crate::Mode::Build`], and if the build was successful,
    /// it will then be changed to [`crate::Mode::Play`]. When the game was closed, the mode will be changed back to
    /// [`crate::Mode::Edit`].
    fn on_mode_changed(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is called when active scene was changed. It could happen if a user opens or loads
    /// a new scene, closes existing scene so the active scene changes to previous in the list of
    /// scenes (if any).
    fn on_scene_changed(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is called when a UI message was extracted from the message queue. It should be used to react to user
    /// changes, for example a user could click a button, then a [`fyrox::gui::button::ButtonMessage::Click`] will be
    /// passed to this method. It then can be used to perform some other action.

    /// This method is called when the editor suspends its execution. It could happen in a few reasons, but the most
    /// common ones are:
    ///
    /// 1) When the main editor's window is unfocused.
    /// 2) When there's no messages coming from the OS to the main editor's window.
    ///
    /// All of these reason means, that a user does nothing with the editor and the editor just "sleeps" in this period of
    /// time, saving precious CPU/GPU resources and keeping power consumption at lowest possible values. Which also means
    /// that cooling fans won't spin like crazy.

    /// This method is called when the editor leaves preview mode. Usually this method is used to
    /// rollback scene changes to the state in which scene objects were before entering the preview
    /// mode. This method is typically called by the editor before execution of any command and before
    /// saving (to prevent "leakage" of preview mode changes into the saved scene).
    fn on_leave_preview_mode(&mut self, #[allow(unused_variables)] editor: &mut Editor) {}

    /// This method is used to tell the editor, whether your plugin is in preview mode or not. Preview mode is a special

    /// preview mode is disabled.
